## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* File an issue, assuming one does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.


## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the master branch.
* To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
`master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are accurate and meaningful.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.


## Submitting Changes

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.github.com/).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the official repository.
* The authors look at pull requests on a regular weekly basis.
* After feedback is given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
